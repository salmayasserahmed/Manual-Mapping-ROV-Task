# Manual-Mapping-ROV-Task-In-Python 
Task 2.1 Flying a transect line over a coral reef and mapping points of interest
Companies must fly a transect line over the coral reef, displaying the video image of the transect on a 
display screen for the station judge. Successfully flying a transect over the coral reef is defined as 
starting at one end of the transect and moving to the other end of the transect. Starting at one end of 
the transect is defined as the ROV directly above the black length of PVC pipe on either end of the coral 
reef.
Circles can be manually overlaid into the proper squares 
for each point of interest (the larger coral will encompass two squares and each square should be 
marked). The two adjacent squares containing the larger coral colony should each be overlaid with a red 
circle. The two squares containing designated areas for outplanting coral fragments should each be 
overlaid with a yellow circle. The two squares containing the Crown of Thorn sea stars should each be 
overlaid with a blue circle.
