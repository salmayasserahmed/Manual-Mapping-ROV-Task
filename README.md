# Manual-Mapping-ROV-Task-In-Python 
Circles can be manually overlaid into the proper squares 
for each point of interest (the larger coral will encompass two squares and each square should be 
marked). The two adjacent squares containing the larger coral colony should each be overlaid with a red 
circle. The two squares containing designated areas for outplanting coral fragments should each be 
overlaid with a yellow circle. The two squares containing the Crown of Thorn sea stars should each be 
overlaid with a blue circle.
